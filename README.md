DevHandProject
==============

A tool to eliminate gotchas as fast as they come up.


Set up a project you are working on and quickly enter the platform/database/languages you are using.

Add notes and any peripheral information to the project.

Ask a question of a project and let us do some of the google-fu for you as well as collate the answers and results
in an organized fashion to bring you relevant API documentation and keep you from digging through twenty minutes 
of unanswered threads to solve your delima.

For now this is a local mobile application to quickly answer a small question or gotcha without having to switch gears and
transition into search engine expert when trying to figure out "Why is my jquery $("myId").text() returning nil?" or "How do I
Join multiple tables in Postgresql?"

With the projects being set up, questions devolve into, "How do I join multiple tables?", "Why is $("myId").text() nil?"
and the results come back in relevant and organized fashion to ensure no fluff and from the palm of your hand.

In the future, the ability to synchronize existing projects and related notes with other team members devices would be
a nice little feature that would make this all the more useful in a small start up environment.

Cheers, Jake.
